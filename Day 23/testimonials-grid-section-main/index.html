                    <p class="description">"Before joinedthe bootcamp. I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from
                        professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to theirs who can
                        only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint.
                        They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project. in
                        particular, was outstanding. it took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
                        could ever have. In fact I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my
                        developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as full-stack developper after
                        receiving multiple offers 100% recommend!"</p>
