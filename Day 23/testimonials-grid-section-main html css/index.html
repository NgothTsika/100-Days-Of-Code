          I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjucts I learned were
          current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I
          got every penny's worth.

          "I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been
          looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an
          amezing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and
          found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter, The next 12
          weeks was the best-and most grueling-time of my life. Since completing
          the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a software
          Engineer at a VR startup."

          "Before joinedthe bootcamp. I've never written a line of code. I
          needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
          programming step by step. I was encouraged to theirs who can only say
          wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff
          did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait
          long for assistance. The agile team project. in particular, was
          outstanding. it took my learning to the next level in a way that no
          tutorial could ever have. In fact I've often referred to it during
          interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly
          helped me land a job as full-stack developper after receiving multiple
          offers 100% recommend!"
