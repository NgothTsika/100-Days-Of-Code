## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Responsive Design
- CSS Animations
- Media queries

### What I learned

I learned how to use the property 'overflow'. I didn't know the concept of overflow before doing this challenge, so I struggled a lots to position the hero-image out of the container.
